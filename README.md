# ArduinoInputExpander
Input expander Arduino Shield using discreet components

Arduino Unos have 2 GPIOs capable of using interrupts.  This is annoying.

This shield uses a 4 Parallel-In Serial-Out shift registers, some OR gates, and a 555 to allow interrupt driven control of up to 32 push buttons.

Each input has a 4.7k pulldown.
